What is Deconstruction?
-> is a mechanism that allow breaking a tuple into individual variables
-> it is also possible to define how deconstruction should work for user-defined typed 
by implementing the Deconstruct method

In this example, the .Net is already implement a Deconstruct, but it is just for getting and example how to do it.

Example:
// From .net 8 or higher we already have implemented the Deconstruct method
var date = new DateTime(2022, 1, 1);  
var (year, month, day) = date;

static class DateTimeExtension {
	public static void Deconstruct(this DateTime date, out int year, out int month, out int day)
	{
		year = date.Year;
		month =  date.Month;
		day = date.Day;
	}
}

Questions:
1. What is the difference between the destructor and the Deconstruct method?
-> destructor is called upon an object when is removed from memory by the Garbage Collector
-> Destruct method is used to split the tuple, value tuple and positional records into individual variables

2. How can we define deconstruction for types that we did not create and we don't have access to their source code?
-> by defining the Deconstruct method as an extension method for this type
