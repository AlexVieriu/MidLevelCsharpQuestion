What is Deconstruction?
-> is a mechanism that allow braking a tuple into individual variables
-> it is also possible to define how deconstruction should work 
for user-defined typed by implementing the Deconstruct method

Questions:
1. What is the difference between the destructor and the Deconstruct method?
-> destructor is called upen an object when is removed from memory by the Garbage Collector
-> Destruct method is used to split the tuple, value tuple and positional records into indivudial variables

2. How can we define deconstruction for types that we did not create and we don't have access to their source code?
-> we can define the Deconstruct method as an extention method for this type

In this example the .Net is already implement a Deconstruct, but it is just for getting and example how to do it.

Example:
var date = new DateTime(2022, 1, 1);  
var (year, month, day) = date;

static class DateTimeExtension {
	public static void Deconstruct(this Datetime date, out int year, out int month, out int day)
	{
		year = date.Year;
		month =  date.Month;
		day = date.Day;
	}
}
