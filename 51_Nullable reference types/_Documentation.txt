Nullable reference types feature allows us to declare a reference type as nullable or not nullable.
The compiler will issue warnings appropriate to the type's nullability.

Nullable reference types feature does not change anything in how the program is executed.
I only changes how compiler warnings are issued.

When to use Nullable ref type?
-> think about fields, properties, variable and parameters in your code:
	-> can they be null or you can be sure that they are not?


Questions:
1. What is the default value of a non-nullable reference types?
-> null

2. What is the purpose of the null-forgiving operator("!"-exclamation mark) ? 
-> allows us to suppress a compiler warning

3. It is possible to enable/disable compiler warnings related to nullable reference types on the file level?
->  it is by using nullable enable and nullable disable preprocessor directives 

#nullable enable
string? nullableString = null;    // Nullable reference, valid to assign null
string nonNullable = null;        // Warning: non-nullable string cannot be null

#nullable disable
string nonNullableAgain = null;  // No warnings, nullable context disabled again
