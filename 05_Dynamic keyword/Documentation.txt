What is the "dynamic" keyword?
-> allow us to bypass static type checking

Static vs Dynamic?
-> in statically-typed languages, type checks happen at compilation time
-> in dynamically-typed languages they happen at runtime

- - - Static typing - - -
Advantages:
-> few runtime errors 
-> no code needed to handle type mismatch
-> easy to understand what object method needs

Disadvantage:
-> always be aware of the variable type
-> language is rigid
-> type declaration take space and clutter the code
-> longer compilation
-> methods are tied to specific types

- - - Dynamic typing - - -
Advantages:
-> ability to use variables without worrying about their type
-> language is elastic 
-> no type declarations are needed 
-> faster compilatiuon/interpretation
-> methods are not tied to specific types 

Disadvantage:
-> more runtime errors 
-> need to create code handling type mismatch
-> can be hard to know what object a method expects 


Questions:
1. What is the difference between strongly-typed and weakly-typed programming languages?
-> strongly-typed: variables are automatically converted from one type to another
-> weakly-typed  : not the case

2. What is the difference between static-typed and dynamic-typed programming languages?
-> static-typed	: type checks are done at compile time 
-> dynamic-typed: type checks are done at runtime
