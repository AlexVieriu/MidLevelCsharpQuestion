-> event is a message send by an object to signal the occurrence of an action 
-> events are the .NET implementation of the Observer design pattern

Questions:
1. What is the difference between an event and a field of the delegate type?
-> a public field of a delegate type can be invoked from anywhere in the code
-> event can be called only from the class they belong to

2. Why is a good practice to unsubscribe from events when a subscribed object
is no longer needed?
-> to prevent memory leak
