What is caching?
-> a mechanism that allows storing some data in memory, so next time it is needed, it can be served faster

(see in the examples how it's used)
-> use Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory
-> add increment value every time the cache is used to see if it's worth it

When to use caching?
-> used to store data from external data sources like databases or API calls
-> for data calculated locally, like performance costly mathematical or graphical calculations results
-> underlying data can change, making the cached data not up to date;
-> when underlying data doesn't change often

You need to have some mechanism that remove the data after a period of time.

Questions:
1. What are the benefits of using cashing?
-> performance boots, if we repeatedly receive data identify with some Key

2. What are the downside of using caching?
-> occupy the application memory
-> it will grow over time and some mechanism need to be used to avoid OutOfMemoryException
