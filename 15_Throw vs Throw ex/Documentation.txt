What is the difference between Throw and Throw ex?

Throw:
-> preserves the stack trace
-> the stack trace will point to the method that caused the exception in the first place

Throw ex:
-> resets the stack trace
-> we will lose the information about the method that caused the exception in the first place

Stack trace
-> is a trace of all methods that have been called, that lead to a particular moment in code
-> helps us track where some exceptions happened

Example:
-> imagine if we have a huge app and when is throwing an exception, all it says is "the object is null"
-> we want to know the exact method and line that cause it

When to use "throw ex""?
-> never
-> if the compile let me to write this "throw new ArgumentException(...)", he is letting me to write this "throw ex"

Questions:
1. What is the stack trace?
-> is a trace of all methods that have been called, that lead to a particular moment in code

2. Should we use "throw" or "throw ex" and why?
-> use throw so we can follow from what line and method the error was thrown
-> never use "throw ex" because it resets the stack trace
