Questions:
1. What is a callback?
-> is an executable code that gets passed as an argument to some other code

2. What is the difference between a framework and a library?
Library:
-> is just a set of functions that we can use

Framework:
-> embodied some abstract design 
-> we plug our own classes and methods into it 
-> has the responsibility to call those classes and methods at proper methods 

Framework relies on Inversion of Control, Libraries don't.

Library: You call the library (you are in control).
Framework: The framework calls you (it’s in control).
