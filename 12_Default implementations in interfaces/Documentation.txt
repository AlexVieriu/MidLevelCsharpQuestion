Interface(with C#8):
-> can have methods implementations(as a default)
-> can have private methods; but only with implementation
-> can have fields (static only)

Access Modifiers for interfaces:
-> if you specify an access modifier for an explicit interface implementation, you get compiler error CS0106

What are default implementation in interfaces?
-> available with C# 8
-> designed to make it easier to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing code
-> enable C# to work with APIs targeting Android and iOS as those languages support similar features
-> enable using traits
	-> a set of methods that can be used to extend the functionality of a class
	-> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)
	-> https://dlang.org/spec/traits.html
	-> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59547812/c-sharp-interface-with-default-method-vs-traits

Recommendation:
-> be aware that such feature exists
-> use interfaces as they were meant to be used before C# 8

1. What could be the reason to use default implementations in interfaces?
-> for nugget packages, so we don't add a lot of extra interfaces for new methods
