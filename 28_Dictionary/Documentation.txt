What is a Dictionary?
-> it's a data structure representing a collection of key value pairs
-> each key in the Dictionary must be unique

When a key is added to the Dictionary, it calculates its hashcode using the GetHashCode method.
It uses this hashcode to properly place the value for the given key 
in the hash table that is the underlying data structure of dictionary.

Dictionary vs Hashtable

Dictionary:
-> generic collection
-> no thread-safe
-> specific data declaration -> no boxing/unboxing -> good performance

Hashtable:
-> non-generic collection
-> thread-safe
-> has boxing-unboxing (poor performance)

Questions:
1. What is a hashtable?
-> is a data structure that stores values in an Array of collections
-> the index of the array is used to calculate the hash code

2. Will the Dictionary works correctly if we have hash code conflict for two of its key?
-> Yes, because the Dictionary is using the Equals() method

3. Why should we override the Equals method when we override the GetHashCode method?
-> Equals method is needed for the Dictionary to distinguish two keys i case of the hash code conflict
