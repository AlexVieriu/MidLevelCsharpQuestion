What is coupling?
-> it's the degree to which one module depends on another module

Strong Coupling:
-> one class is depending on another 

Loose coupling:
-> classes are independent

Recognizing high coupling:
-> one type is using other type directly without having any abstraction in between
-> a small change in the class leads to a cascading change in the project
-> classes are not independent; we need to perform a lot of operations on other classes to make some class work

Questions:
1. How you can detect a strongly couple types?
-> if a change in a class leads to a cascading changing in a lot of classes

2. Which of the SOLID principles allow us to reduce coupling?
-> Inversion of Control
