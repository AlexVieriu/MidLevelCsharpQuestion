"Is" keyword: 
-> used to check if an object is of a given type.
-> returns a boolean as a result

"As" keyword:
-> used to cast a variable to a given type
-> can be cast only for reference types/Nullable types 

Regular casting vs "as" keyword
-> regular casting throws and exception
-> "as" returns null

Questions:
1. What is the difference between regular cast and casting with "as" keyword?
-> regular cast will throw an runtime error when it fail casting 
-> "as" keyword return null if failed casting

2. Why can we only use the "as" keyword to cast objects to nullable types?
-> because if casting with "as" failles, null will be returned
-> null can only be assign to Nullable types
