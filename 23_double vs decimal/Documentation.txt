Double vs Decimal?

Double:
-> a floating-point binary number
-> optimized for performance
-> 8bytes					(smaller size)
-> 5*10^-324  to 5*10^308	(bigger range) 

Decimal:
-> a floating-point decimal number
-> optimized for precision
-> 16bytes					(bigger size)
-> 5*10^-28  to 5*10^28		(smaller range) 

Floating-point numbers:
-> 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 (can't be integer)

mantissa =	scaled representation of the number (12362)
exponent =	says what the scale is (123.62)
			will say where the decimal point(".") will be
			that's why they are called floating numbers, because the point is moving

Decimal:
-> 32456 * 10^(-2) = 324.56 (this is in base 10 for double, not in base 2 - for decimal)

Double:
-> 1 bit for sign, 52 for mantissa and 11 for exponent)

Note:
-> a variable of Double type can have a specific value called NaN - Not a number
ex: 0/0 = NaN
-> for Decimal u get and compilation error

When to use doubles:
-> representing "natural" number
-> length, speed, position
-> industrial application, games

When to use decimal:
-> representing "human-made" numbers, that need to be precisely represented
-> money, points in games
-> finance

Questions:
1. What is the difference between double and float?
-> double on 64bits, float is on 32bits
-> they are the same in the rest

2. What is the NaN?
-> it's a result from operation with double numbers that can't be done
-> ex: 0/0
-> not a number

3. What numeric type should be use to represent money?
-> decimal
