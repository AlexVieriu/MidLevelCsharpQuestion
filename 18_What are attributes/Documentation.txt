What are attributes?
-> attributes add metadata to a type
-> are a way to add information about a type or a method to the existing metadata 
which describes that type or method, which we can read from the Type object

Metadata:
-> is data providing information about some data

Method chaining:

var propertiesToValidate = obj
    .GetType()
    .GetProperties()
    .Where(property => Attribute.IsDefined(property, typeof(StringLengthValidateAttribute)));

about what methods or constructors it contains
