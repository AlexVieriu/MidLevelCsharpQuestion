What is Template Method design pattern?
-> defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the base class
-> specific steps of this algorithm are implemented in derived class

Inheritance vs Composition?

Inheritance: 
-> is a mechanism where a new class, called a derived class, inherits the properties 
and behaviors (methods) of an existing class, called a base class.
-> the derived class can add new properties and methods or override existing ones.

Composition:
-> a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, rather than inheriting from them
-> allows you to build complex types by combining objects, giving more flexibility as behavior can be changed at runtime

Questions:
1. What is the difference between the Template Method design pattern and the Strategy design pattern?
-> Template method: selected at compile time, uses inheritance
-> Strategy: selected at runtime, uses composition
