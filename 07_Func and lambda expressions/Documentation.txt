Lambda expression:

[Func\Action method] = ([input parameters]) => [expression]

Ex:
Func<int, int, int> addFunc = (x, y) => x + y;

Func<T1, T2,..., Tout> funcFunction = (T1,T2,T3,...) => [expression that return a result of Tout type]
Action<T1,T2,...> actionFunction = (T1,T2,T3,...) => [void expression] 


-> lamba expression is good when we declare short specific function
-> used a lot when working with link


Questions:
1. What is the signature of a function that can be assigned to a variable of a type 
Func<int, int, bool>?
-> takes 2 int parameters and return a bool 

2. What is an Action?
-> it is a void function
