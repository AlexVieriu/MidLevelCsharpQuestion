What are indexers?
-> allow instances of a type to be indexed just like arrays
-> most often used with types representing collections(can be added to any type)

Find the definition of index:
-> right click on List -> go to implementation -> search for "index"

I can add as many indexer as i want.

Questions:
1. It is possible to have a class with an indexer accepting a string as a parameter?
-> Yes 
public T this[string index]

2. Can we have more than one indexer defined in a class?
-> Yes 
public T this[int index1, int index2]
