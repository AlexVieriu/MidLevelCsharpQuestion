Dependency Injections:
-> providing the objects that some class needs from the outside, instead of having it construct them itself

Advantages:
-> loosely couple
-> flexibility

Questions:
1. What are Dependency Injection frameworks?
-> mechanisms that automatically create dependencies and inject them into objects that need them

2. What are the benefits of using Dependency Injection?
-> decouples a class from his dependencies
-> the class doesn't make the decision what concrete type it will use; 
it only declares on the constructor what interfaces it will need
