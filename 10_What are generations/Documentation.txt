Garbage Collector responsibilities:
-> identifying objects to that are no longer needed 
-> remove those objects from memory
-> defragment the memory 

Optimisation:
-> if some objects survives a couple of cycles of the Garbage Collector's work, it's most likely long-lived
and should be removed only once every couple of cycles of the Garbage Collector's work 

Every object is placed on Generation 0,1,2(0 frequently, 2 less frequently)

Generation 2: Full garbage collection (because it collect generation 0 and 1 too)

Ex: 
-> logger object (long leave)
-> LINQ object (short leave)

Large Objects Heap:
-> more then > 85000B
-> it is stored in a special collection: large objects heap
-> it's assign to generation 2 
-> they will not be moved in memory during the fragmentation

Questions:
1. What is the Large Objects Heap(LOH)?
-> is the speacial aria of the HEAP result for objects larger then 85000bites
-> belong to generation 2 from the beginning

2. What does it mean that hte objec tis pinnned?
-> will not be moved during the fragmentation
