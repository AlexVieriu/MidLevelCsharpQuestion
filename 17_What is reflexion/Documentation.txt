What is reflexion?
-> it's a mechanism that allows us to write code that can inspect types used in the application
-> allows us to access some information at runtime

Reflexion abilities
-> loading *.dll at runtime
-> instantiating objects or given type at runtime
-> finding all classes with the given [base type]/[implemented interface]
-> reading the attributes
-> running a method by its name
-> debugging
-> creating new types at runtime(System.Reflection.Emit)

Reflexion downside
-> hard to maintain and understand 
-> prone to errors
-> big performance impact
