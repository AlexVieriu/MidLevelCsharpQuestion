Why is catch(Exception) almost always a bad idea(and when is not)?
-> because when you catch an exception, you shoould handle it appropriately
-> it's hard to do if the type is not specific

What other exception can be thrown?
-> StackOverflowException, OutOfMemoryException 

Example LINQ:
.First() method can throw:
	-> ArgumentNullException
	-> InvalidOperationException

-> we can find what kind of exception a method is throwing by hover over the method
-> never mask the exceptions with general exceptions

When to use general catch(Exception)?
-> in the Program.cs folder

In Big projects, the application is multilayered and each layer has his own reporting and organizing errors.
GUI layer			-> show (green color)
Business layer		-> log	(orange color)
Data Access layer	-> throw(red color)

GUI-> graphical user interface

Summary:
-> using "catch(Exception)" should be avoided because it catches every kind of exception
-> when we decide to catch an exception, we should know how to handle it, and it's not feasible if the exception's type is unknown
-> we should be precise in both catching/throwing exceptions

Questions:
1. What are the acceptable cases of catching any type of exception?
-> the global catch block (ex: Program.cs)
-> any catch block where we rethrown an exception without handling it

2. what is the global catch block?
-> it's the catch block defend on the most upper level of the application
