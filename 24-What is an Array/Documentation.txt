What is an Array?
-> is the most basic collection in C#
-> think as a collection of boxes, each one holding a single value
-> each box has its index, starting at zero and ending at array length -1
-> one an Array is created, the size can't be changed
-> not a good choice if the collection is changing

Advantages:
-> are reference types
-> most native types of collection, many other collections base on them
-> are fast; we can get or set element at index in constant time
-> multidimensional array are commonly used in mathematical usage and games(snake/chess)

Disadvantages:
-> their size is fixed
-> it's not a dynamic collection
-> we can't Add/Remove elements

Usage:
-> when the size is known upfront, otherwise don't use them

Questions:
1. What is a jagged array?

2. What are the advantages of using arrays? 
-> they are fast
-> basic and easy to use

3. What are the disadvantages of using arrays?
-> are fix size, so we can't add/remove along the way
-> can be a waste of memory if we allocate to much memory, just for some occasional situation

4. How to resize an array?
-> you can't
