What is an ArrayList?
-> it's an dynamic collection, that can hold any type of items
-> treats everything it holds as an instances of System.Object type

Boxing:
-> is a process of "wrapping" a value type in an object
-> it result in storing this value on the HEAP instead of the STACK, and creating a reference to it

Ex:
object obj = (object)5;
